# Predicting-Travel-Insurance-Claims

This project aims to predict whether a particular insurance claim should be given out or not. Using historical data containing details about claims that were and weren't given, the aim is to predict claims for unseen data (claims filed in future).

This project takes the reader through the data cleansing, feature engineering, and modelling aspects of the solution.
